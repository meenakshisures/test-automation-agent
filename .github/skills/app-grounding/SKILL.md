description: Build and maintain the grounded app model (Page Objects + selector map) from the live application's accessibility tree, so generated locators reference real elements. Use before generating specs for a page not yet in the model.

# App grounding

The single biggest lever on "runs without edits": never let the generator invent
selectors. Every selector must come from an element that actually exists.

## Maintain the model

- The model lives in `app-model/selectors.json` and `app-model/pages/*.ts`.
- When an IR references a page or element not in the model, ground it:
  1. Open the live app (Playwright MCP accessibility snapshot, or
     `page.locator(...).all()` exploration in a scratch script).
  2. Capture stable handles. **Selector priority:** `getByRole` →
     `getByTestId` / `data-test` → `getByLabel` / `getByText` → CSS as a last
     resort. Never use nth-child chains or auto-generated class hashes.
  3. Add the element to `selectors.json` and expose it as a `Locator` on the
     relevant Page Object with an intent-named method.

## Drift

If a previously-grounded selector no longer resolves during a run, re-snapshot
that page and update the model — then let the generator/healer reuse it. Record
the change so the fix is reviewable.
